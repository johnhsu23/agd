This directory houses factories for the `Legend` model hierarchy (see `models/legend.ts` and the `models/legend/` directory). These factories are shorthand for commonly-used footnotes, especially for textual symbols like &Dagger; and &mdash;.

See also the `gather` module, which assists in collecting footnotes from an array of data points that have NDE error flags in them.
