This directory is home to code that wouldn't otherwise have a home.

Right now there are two kinds of modules living here. The first is decorators (see `configure` for adjusting a class' prototype) and a few formatting functions (like `format-list` and `nth`). There's also a module for doing linear interpolation, if you're in to that sort of thing.
