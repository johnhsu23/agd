<div class="glossary__description">In the case of NAEP, the population of interest is the entire collection of American students in public or private schools at grades 4, 8, or 12 (or in the case of the long-term trend assessments, at ages 9, 13, and 17 years). The small <a href="" class="iframe cboxElement" data-glossary="sample">samples</a> of students that NAEP selects for the assessment permit inferences about academic performance to be made for all school students at the three grade or age levels.</div>
