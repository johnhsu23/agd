<div class="glossary__title">accommodation</div>
<div class="glossary__description">A change in how a test is presented, in how it is administered, or in how the test taker is allowed to respond. This term generally refers to changes that do not substantially alter what the test measures. The proper use of accommodations does not substantially change academic level or performance criteria. Appropriate accommodations are made to provide equal opportunity to demonstrate knowledge. The most frequently used accommodations in NAEP are large-print booklets, extended time in regular test sessions, reading questions aloud in regular sessions, small groups, one-on-one sessions, scribes or use of computers to record answers, bilingual booklets (mathematics assessment only), and bilingual dictionaries (not for the reading assessment). In NAEP, accommodations may be provided to certain <a href="" class="iframe cboxElement" data-glossary="sd">students with disabilities (SD)</a> and/or <a href="" class="iframe cboxElement" data-glossary="ell">English language learners (ELL)</a>, as specified in the student's Individualized Education Program (IEP).</div>
