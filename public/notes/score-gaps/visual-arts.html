<div>NOTE: The NAEP responding scale for visual arts ranges from 0–300. Black includes African American, and Hispanic includes Latino. Race categories exclude Hispanic origin. In compliance with new standards from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget for collecting and reporting data on race/ethnicity, additional information was collected beginning in 2011 so that results could be reported separately for Asian students and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander students. Students who identified with two or more of the other racial/ethnic groups (e.g., White and Black) would have been classified as “Other” and reported as part of the "Unclassified" category prior to 2011, and classified as “Two or More Races” in 2011 and later assessment years. Beginning in the 2014–15 school year, states could additionally categorize students as eligible for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) by including them in their Community Eligibility Provision; therefore, the percentage of students categorized as eligible has increased in comparison to previous assessment years. Readers should interpret NSLP trend results with caution. The category students with disabilities includes students identified as having either an Individualized Education Program or protection under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The results for students with disabilities and English language learners are based on students who were assessed and cannot be generalized to the total population of such students.

Score differences are calculated based on unrounded average scores. The positions of the data points in the graphics are based on the unrounded numbers. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.</div>
