        <p>The average responding score in 2016 for eighth-graders who reported taking courses in music and visual arts were higher than those who reported not taking such classes. While the percentages of students reporting taking music and/or visual arts classes has not changed significantly compared to 2008, in general, lower percentages of students reported engaging in music or visual arts activities outside of school. The average scores for eighth-graders did not change significantly between 2016 and 2008; however, the score gap between White and Hispanic students narrowed in both music and visual arts.</p>

      <div class="section__commentary section__commentary--homepage">
        <p>In both subjects, female students outperformed their male peers in 2016, students in suburban schools outperformed those in city schools, and those in private and Catholic schools outperformed students in public schools. Students eligible for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) scored lower in both subjects than those not eligible. Higher percentages of students in private schools reported taking visual arts classes than those attending public schools. Please note when interpreting these results that NAEP survey questionnaire results are intended to place results in context. They CANNOT be used to infer cause-and-effect relationships between student characteristics and achievement.</p>

        <p>The 2016 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) arts assessment was given to a nationally representative sample of 8,800 eighth-graders across 280 public and private schools. Approximately one-half of these students were assessed in <a href="/#/about">music</a>, while the other half were assessed in <a href="/#/about">visual arts</a>. Approximately half of students who were assessed in music received responding questions only, while the other half received responding and creating questions.  All students assessed in visual arts received both responding and creating questions.</p>

        <p>The music assessment measured students' ability to respond to music in various ways. Students were asked to analyze and describe aspects of music they heard, critique instrumental and vocal performances, and demonstrate their knowledge of standard musical notation and music's role in society. For example, after listening to a piece of music, students were asked to identify the music’s region of origin and to describe a feature of the music that helped them to identify the part of the world that they selected. The average responding score for music was reported on a 0&ndash;300 scale. </p>
        <p>The visual arts portion of the 2016 arts assessment measured students’ ability to respond to art as well as their ability to create original artwork. Responding questions asked students to analyze and describe works of art and design. The average responding score for visual arts was reported on a 0&ndash;300 scale. Creating questions required students to create works of art and design of their own. For example, student were asked to create a self-portrait that was scored for identifying detail, compositional elements, and use of materials. The average creating task score was reported separately from responding scores as the average percentage of the maximum possible score from 0 to 100.</p>

        <h3>The Story of NAEP</h3>
        <p>The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is a continuing and nationally representative measure of trends in academic achievement of U.S. elementary and secondary students in various subjects. It is the largest continuing and nationally representative assessment of what our nation’s students know and can do in select subjects. It was first administered in 1969 to measure student achievement nationally. Teachers, principals, parents, policymakers, and researchers all use NAEP results to assess progress and develop ways to improve education in the United States. <a target="_blank" href="http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/">Read more</a></p>
