          <p>Average scores for eighth&ndash;graders were not significantly different between 2008 and 2016. Students who reported taking courses in music and visual arts scored higher, on average, than those not taking such classes. While the percentages of students who reported taking music and/or visual arts classes did not change significantly, lower percentages of students reported engaging in some music or visual arts activities outside of school between 2008 and 2016. Students were assessed separately on <a data-glossary-term="responded" href="#">responding</a> to existing works of music and visual art and <a data-glossary-term="created" href="#">creating</a> their own original artwork.</p>

          <p class="u-font-medium">Students' ability to <a data-glossary-term="responding-process" href="#">respond</a> to music was measured in various ways. Responding questions asked students to analyze and describe aspects of music they heard, critique instrumental and vocal performances, and demonstrate their knowledge of standard musical notation and music's role in society. For example, after listening to a piece of music, students were asked to identify the music's region of origin and to describe a feature of the music that helped them to identify the part of the world that they selected. The average <a data-glossary-term="music-responding-score" href="#">responding score</a> for music was reported on a 0&ndash;300 scale.</p>
          <p class="u-font-medium">The assessment included one music creating question; therefore, only the responding process in music was reported for the 2016 arts assessment.</p>

Responding questions asked students to analyze and describe works of art and design. For example, a responding question asked students to analyze the aesthetic properties of two self-portraits created by twentieth-century artists and to identify technical similarities between the two artworks. The average responding score for visual arts was reported on a 0&ndash;300 scale.</p>
          <p class="u-font-medium">Creating questions required students to design and create their own works of art. For example, students were asked to create a self-portrait that was scored for identifying detail, compositional elements, and use of a variety of provided <a href="#/about?anchor=design">arts materials</a>. The average <a data-glossary-term="visual-arts-score" href="#">creating task score</a> was reported separately from responding scores as the average percentage of the maximum possible score from 0 to 100.</p>

        <h3>The Story of NAEP</h3>
        <p>The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is a continuing and nationally representative measure of trends in academic achievement of U.S. elementary and secondary students in various subjects. It is the largest continuing and nationally representative assessment of what our nation's students know and can do in select subjects. It was first administered in 1969 to measure student achievement nationally. Teachers, principals, parents, policymakers, and researchers all use NAEP results to assess progress and develop ways to improve education in the United States. <a target="_blank" href="http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/">Read more</a></p>
