        <p>The average responding score in 2016 for eighth-graders who reported taking courses in music and visual arts were higher than those who reported not taking such classes. While the percentages of students reporting taking music and/or visual arts classes has not changed significantly compared to 2008, in general, lower percentages of students reported engaging in music or visual arts activities outside of school. The average scores for eighth-graders did not change significantly between 2016 and 2008; however, the score gap between White and Hispanic students narrowed in both music and visual arts.</p>

      <div class="section__commentary section__commentary--homepage">
        <p>In both subjects, female students outperformed their male peers in 2016, students in suburban schools outperformed those in city schools, and those in private and Catholic schools outperformed students in public schools. Students eligible for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) scored lower in both subjects than those not eligible. Higher percentages of students in private schools reported taking visual arts classes than those attending public schools. Please note when interpreting these results that NAEP survey questionnaire results are intended to place results in context. They CANNOT be used to infer cause-and-effect relationships between student characteristics and achievement.</p>
