      <div class="section__commentary">
        <p>The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) arts assessment measures students’ knowledge and skills in the arts disciplines of music and visual arts. Students were evaluated in two arts processes — responding and creating. Responding questions in music asked students to respond to music in a variety of ways; students were asked to analyze, interpret, or critique a piece of music that they listened to or to describe the social, historical, or social context of a piece of music. Creating questions in music asked students to use musical notation to apply their musical ideas after evaluating written or recorded pieces of music. Responding questions in visual arts asked students to analyze, describe, or judge works of art and design to show understanding of form, aesthetics, and cultural or historical context. Creating questions in visual arts asked students to use form, media, or techniques to create original works of art and design to communicate an idea.</p>
        <p>In 2016, performance results at grade 8 were reported for the nation overall and for selected student demographic groups, such as race/ethnicity, gender, and the highest level of parental education.</p>

      <div class="section__commentary">
        <p>The National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) oversees the development of NAEP frameworks that describe the specific knowledge and skills to be assessed in each subject and how the assessment questions should be designed and scored.</p>
        <p>The NAEP arts assessment framework is rooted in the belief that the arts are essential to every child’s complete development. The arts are as basic as literacy and numeracy in U.S. education and are an important vehicle for learning the skills valued by education reformers and the business community, including problem-solving, higher order thinking, flexibility, persistence, and cooperation. In addition, the arts have a unique capacity to integrate the intellect, emotions, and physical skills to construct meaning. In order for students to place the arts in broader contexts and to fully appreciate their significance, they need to have the ability to use artistic processes—such as creating and responding—to draw upon their knowledge and understanding of the arts in order to construct meaning.</p>
        <p>The arts assessment was developed and reviewed by a committee of arts experts to capture the goals of the arts framework. NAGB oversaw a comprehensive national process reflecting the input of arts educators, artists, assessment specialists, policymakers, representatives from the business community, and members of the public. The National Standards for Arts Education also served as an important reference in the development of the NAEP arts framework.</p>
        <p>The arts framework specifies that students’ arts knowledge and skills be measured in four arts disciplines: music, visual arts, dance, and theatre. Additionally, three arts processes—responding, creating, and performing—are central to students’ experiences in these disciplines. The responding process refers to observing, describing, analyzing, and evaluating works of art, while the creating process refers to expressing ideas and feelings in the form of an original work of art. Due to budget constraints and the small percentage of schools with dance and theatre programs, only the responding process in music and both the responding and creating processes in visual arts were assessed in 2016 and in 2008, the previous assessment year.  </p>

      <div class="section__commentary">
        <p>Because of the breadth of content covered in the NAEP arts assessment, each student was assessed in only one arts discipline, either music or visual arts. The responding process in both music and visual arts was assessed with multiple-choice questions and constructed-response questions that asked students to write an answer of a few words or sentences. The creating process in visual arts was assessed by constructed response questions that required students to both generate written answers and to create their own original works of visual art. Read more about the types of questions included on the arts assessment.</p>
        <p>One of the challenges of the arts assessment was scoring students’ work, due to the nature of the question types. Unlike most other NAEP assessments, visual arts, included tasks which required students to create their responses (e.g., drawing), in addition to questions which required traditional response types such as writing. Specific scoring guides were developed for the responding questions in music and the responding and creating questions in visual arts. Scorers were then trained to apply these criteria appropriately when evaluating students’ responses that demonstrated a wide range of skill levels in music and visual arts. The scoring guides for the sample questions presented in this report, and other released questions from the assessment, are available in the NAEP Questions Tool (NQT).</p>
