      <div class="section__commentary">
        <p>The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) arts assessment measures students’ knowledge and skills in the arts disciplines of music and visual arts. Students were evaluated in two arts processes — responding and creating. Responding questions in music asked students to respond to music in a variety of ways; students were asked to analyze, interpret, or critique a piece of music that they listened to or to describe the social, historical, or social context of a piece of music. Creating questions in music asked students to use musical notation to apply their musical ideas after evaluating written or recorded pieces of music. Responding questions in visual arts asked students to analyze, describe, or judge works of art and design to show understanding of form, aesthetics, and cultural or historical context. Creating questions in visual arts asked students to use form, media, or techniques to create original works of art and design to communicate an idea.</p>
        <p>In 2016, performance results at grade 8 were reported for the nation overall and for selected student demographic groups, such as race/ethnicity, gender, and the highest level of parental education.</p>

      <div class="section__subtitle">The NAEP Arts Framework</div>
      <div class="section__commentary">
        <p>The National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) oversees the development of NAEP frameworks that describe the specific knowledge and skills to be assessed in each subject and how the assessment questions should be designed and scored.</p>
        <p>The NAEP arts assessment framework is rooted in the belief that the arts are essential to every child’s complete development. The arts are as basic as literacy and numeracy in U.S. education and are an important vehicle for learning the skills valued by education reformers and the business community, including problem-solving, higher order thinking, flexibility, persistence, and cooperation. In addition, the arts have a unique capacity to integrate the intellect, emotions, and physical skills to construct meaning. In order for students to place the arts in broader contexts and to fully appreciate their significance, they need to have the ability to use artistic processes—such as creating and responding—to draw upon their knowledge and understanding of the arts in order to construct meaning.</p>
        <p>The arts assessment was developed and reviewed by a committee of arts experts to capture the goals of the arts framework. NAGB oversaw a comprehensive national process reflecting the input of arts educators, artists, assessment specialists, policymakers, representatives from the business community, and members of the public. The National Standards for Arts Education also served as an important reference in the development of the NAEP arts framework.</p>
        <p>The arts framework specifies that students’ arts knowledge and skills be measured in four arts disciplines: music, visual arts, dance, and theatre. Additionally, three arts processes—responding, creating, and performing—are central to students’ experiences in these disciplines. The responding process refers to observing, describing, analyzing, and evaluating works of art, while the creating process refers to expressing ideas and feelings in the form of an original work of art. Due to budget constraints and the small percentage of schools with dance and theatre programs, only the responding process in music and both the responding and creating processes in visual arts were assessed in 2016 and in 2008, the previous assessment year.  </p>

      <div class="section__subtitle">Assessment Design and Scoring</div>
      <div class="section__commentary">
        <p>Because of the breadth of content covered in the NAEP arts assessment, each student was assessed in only one arts discipline, either music or visual arts. The responding process in both music and visual arts was assessed with multiple-choice questions and constructed-response questions that asked students to write an answer of a few words or sentences. The creating process in visual arts was assessed by constructed response questions that required students to both generate written answers and to create their own original works of visual art. Read more about the types of questions included on the arts assessment.</p>
        <p>One of the challenges of the arts assessment was scoring students’ work, due to the nature of the question types. Unlike most other NAEP assessments, visual arts, included tasks which required students to create their responses (e.g., drawing), in addition to questions which required traditional response types such as writing. Specific scoring guides were developed for the responding questions in music and the responding and creating questions in visual arts. Scorers were then trained to apply these criteria appropriately when evaluating students’ responses that demonstrated a wide range of skill levels in music and visual arts. The scoring guides for the sample questions presented in this report, and other released questions from the assessment, are available in the NAEP Questions Tool (NQT).</p>

       <div class="section__subtitle">NAEP Samples</div>
      <div class="section__commentary">
        <p>The schools and students participating in NAEP assessments are selected to be representative of all schools and students nationally. The results from the 2016 arts assessment at grade 8 were based on a representative sample of 8,800 eighth-graders from 280 schools. Approximately one-half of the eighth-grade students were assessed in music (4,300 students) and the other half were assessed in visual arts (4,400 students). The national sample of schools and students is drawn from across the country. The results from the assessed students are combined to provide accurate estimates of the overall performance of students in the nation. Unlike NAEP assessments in other subjects such as, reading, mathematics, and science, the arts assessment sample was not designed to report results for individual states or large urban districts. Download the summary data tables below to see the national sample sizes for the 2016 arts assessment.</p>
        <p>Each school that participated in the assessment, and each student assessed, represents only a portion of the larger population of interest. The results are weighted to account for the disproportionate representation of some groups in the selected sample, including the oversampling of schools with high concentrations of students from certain racial/ethnic groups and the lower sampling rates of students who attend small schools.

      <div class="section__subtitle">NAEP Inclusion</div>
      <div class="section__commentary">
        <p>It is important for NAEP to assess as many students selected to participate as possible. Assessing representative samples of students, including students with disabilities (SD) and English language learners (ELL), helps to ensure that NAEP results accurately reflect the educational performance of all students in the target population, and can continue to serve as a meaningful measure of U.S. students’ academic achievement over time.</p>
        <p>To ensure that all selected students from the population can be assessed, many of the same accommodations that SD and ELL students use on other tests are provided for those students participating in NAEP. Read more about accommodations available in NAEP. Even with the availability of accommodations, some students may still be excluded. Download the summary data tables below to see the percentages of SD and/or ELL students identified, excluded, and assessed in 2016 in arts.</p>
        <p>The National Assessment Governing Board, which sets policy for NAEP, has been exploring ways to ensure that NAEP continues to appropriately include as many students as possible and to do so in a consistent manner for all jurisdictions and districts assessed and for which results are reported. In March 2010, the Governing Board adopted a new policy outlining specific inclusion goals for NAEP samples. The goal is to include 95 percent of all students selected for the NAEP samples, and 85 percent of those in the NAEP sample who are identified as SD or ELL. Read more about the inclusion policy and how the percentages of students are calculated.</p>

       <div class="section__subtitle">School and Student Participation</div>
      <div class="section__commentary">
        <p>To ensure unbiased samples, NAEP requires that participation rates for original school samples be 70 percent or higher to report national results separately for public and private schools. The results for private and Catholic schools are presented in the report since, in 2016, the school participation rates for private and Catholic schools overall met the 70 percent criteria for reporting in music and visual arts at grade 8. In instances where participation rates meet the 70 percent criteria but fall below 85 percent, a nonresponse bias analysis is conducted to determine whether the responding school sample is not representative of the population, thereby introducing the potential for nonresponse bias.  </p>
        <p>Before substituting replacement schools for originally sampled schools that declined to participate, the weighted national school participation rates for the music and visual arts portions of the 2016 arts assessment at grade 8 were 93 percent (95 percent for public schools, 76 percent for private schools, and 100 percent for Catholic schools).</p>
        <p>Weighted student participation rates at grade 8 were 93 percent for the music portion of the assessment (93 percent for public school students, 91 percent for private school students, and 93 percent for Catholic school students); for the visual arts portion, weighted student participation rates were 94 percent at grade 8 (94 percent for public school students, 93 percent for private school students, and 95 percent for Catholic school students.</p>
        <p>Nonresponse bias analyses were conducted for the private school sample (which included Catholic schools) at grade 8 in 2016. The results showed that school substitution and nonresponse adjustments were effective in reducing the potential for nonresponse bias in the arts assessment.</p>
