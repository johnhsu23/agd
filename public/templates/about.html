      <div class="section__contents">The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) arts assessment measures students’ knowledge and skills in the arts disciplines of music and visual arts. Students were evaluated in two arts processes — responding and creating. Responding questions in music asked students to respond to music in a variety of ways; students were asked to analyze, interpret, or critique a piece of music that they listened to or to describe the social, historical, or social context of a piece of music. Creating questions in music asked students to use musical notation to apply their musical ideas after evaluating written or recorded pieces of music. Responding questions in visual arts asked students to analyze, describe, or judge works of art and design to show understanding of form, aesthetics, and cultural or historical context. Creating questions in visual arts asked students to use form, media, or techniques to create original works of art and design to communicate an idea. <p>In 2016, performance results at grade 8 were reported for the nation overall and for selected student demographic groups, such as race/ethnicity, gender, and the highest level of parental education. </p>
