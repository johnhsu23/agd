<div class="question__question">
  <p>Open your packets and look at your two prints. Each print shows an image of a self-portrait created by a twentieth-century artist. Self-portrait A is by Kathe Kollwitz, and self-portrait B is by Egon Schiele. A "self-portrait" is an artwork that shows the person who created the work. The self-portraits you will be working with for this task, both of which show the faces and upper bodies of the artists, tell important things about the personalities of the people who created them. After you answer some questions about the works, you will create your own self-portrait.</p>
  <p>As you answer the questions about each self-portrait, think carefully about what the artists might have wanted to communicate about themselves in their self-portraits. Now look at each of the artworks closely and answer the questions in your test booklet.</p>
  <p>Now put your white drawing paper, oil pastels, a mirror, and your charcoal pencil in front of you.</p>
  <p>Think about how you could communicate something important about your personality by drawing your face and upper body.</p>
  <p>Using the materials in any way you choose, create a self-portrait that will communicate to a viewer something you think is important about your personality. You may use the mirror if you wish.</p>

  <h4>Score and Description</h4>
  <h5 class="u-margin-none">SUFFICIENT</h5>
  <p>Observation is clear and specific, identifying detail is skillfully incorporated and developed, compositional elements are used purposefully, and the use of materials is sensitive.</p>
  <h5 class="u-margin-none">UNEVEN</h5>
  <p>Some specific observations are present. Compositional elements employed are sometimes pertinent and sometimes not. There is some attention to detail to convey expression and/or effective use of materials to communicate. However, works are typically somewhat inconsistent or incomplete in parts.</p>
  <h5 class="u-margin-none">MINIMAL</h5>
  <p>Efforts at specific observations are apparent, but relatively minimal. Compositional successes may seem more accidental than deliberate, and use of materials is unskilled.</p>
  <h5 class="u-margin-none">INSUFFICIENT</h5>
  <p>Observation is unspecific, there is little awareness of composition, and use of materials is highly unskilled.</p>

  <h4>Sample Responses</h4>
  <h5 class="u-margin-none">SUFFICIENT</h5>
  <div>
    <img src="images/questions/self-portrait-sufficient.gif" alt="SUFFICIENT: detailed sketch of a girl's face, neck, and upper arms; hair is in a ponytail, ears and earrings are shown, color is used to add depth to drawing.">
    <p>Characteristic of works at the highest level, this self-portrait shows clear and specific observation. It incorporates identifying detail in terms of personal features. The self-portrait shows purposeful use of compositional elements and sensitive use of materials. The work also shows both skillful use of proportion, color, and line, and is fully developed and individualized. For example, the student has used color very selectively so that it emphasizes and creates contrast between specific parts of her portrait. (The student commented in her self-evaluation that she sought to show both sorrow and faith in her self-portrait.)</p>
  </div>
  <h5 class="u-margin-none">UNEVEN</h5>
  <div>
    <img src="images/questions/self-portrait-uneven.gif" alt="UNEVEN: drawing of a woman with complete facial features and hair, plus upper torso, jewelery and scribbling of color.">
    <p>Works at the Uneven level made some specific observations. They sometimes employed pertinent compositional elements, gave attention to details such as facial features to convey expression, and/or effectively used materials to communicate. However, Uneven works are typically somewhat inconsistent or incomplete in parts. This artist gives her work individuality by her vivid use of color, facial expression, and the symbols she incorporates in her jewelry and the background of her work. However, elements of her work seem inconsistent and lacking in deliberation, and detract from the overall effect; for example, the somewhat careless placement of background elements, and the lack of clarity of others.</p>
  </div>
  <h5 class="u-margin-none">MINIMAL</h5>
  <div>
    <img src="images/questions/self-portrait-minimal.gif" alt="MINIMAL: sketch of a male face including neck, colored shirt, and color for lips and eyes.">
    <p>As with many works at this level, in this self-portrait, efforts at specific observations are apparent, but relatively minimal (the red lines in the eyes). Compositional successes may seem more accidental than deliberate, and use of materials is unskilled. For example, this student has chosen to emphasize only his eyes and mouth with color. However, the student lacks the skill to make this choice distinctive enough to convey his message.</p>
  </div>
  <h5 class="u-margin-none">INSUFFICIENT</h5>
  <div>
    <img src="images/questions/self-portrait-insufficient.gif" alt="INSUFFICIENT: simple crude sketch of an oval face ">
    <p>Most self-portraits at this level were so schematic as to convey little or nothing about the artist. Like this one, they showed unspecific observation, little awareness of composition, and highly unskilled use of materials.</p>
