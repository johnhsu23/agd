  <h3>Sample Responses</h3>
  <p>ACCEPTABLE - Student Response</p>
  <div>
    <img src="img/questions/VC00002-acceptable-1.gif" alt="ACCEPTABLE: student response is 'Charcoal can get very dark when you press harder than normal.'">
    <img src="img/questions/VC00002-acceptable-2.gif" alt="ACCEPTABLE: student response is 'It leaves little white specks because it dosen't fill in every little bump or spot on the page.'">
    <p>This student shows very good knowledge of charcoal as a medium. The student is able to express him or herself in terms of what the artist could accomplish with the charcoal, as seen in the Kollwitz self-portrait.</p>
  </div>
  <p>PARTIAL - Student Response</p>
  <div>
    <img src="img/questions/VC00002-partial-1.gif" alt="PARTIAL: student response is 'One is the harder the charcoal is pushed down, the darker the markings will be.'">
    <img src="img/questions/VC00002-partial-2.gif" alt="PARTIAL: student response is 'It is not drawn straight but, like it was colored in.'">
    <p>This student also refers to the fact that the harder you press with charcoal, the darker the mark, as is visible in the Kollwitz portrait. It is not entirely clear what the second part of the response is referring to, but in any case charcoal can be used to draw a straight line.</p>
  </div>
  <p>UNACCEPTABLE - Student Response</p>
  <div>
    <img src="img/questions/VC00002-unacceptable-1.gif" alt="UNACCEPTABLE: student response is 'he's looking at something or he is trying to get your attention of something he's looking at'">
    <img src="img/questions/VC00002-unacceptable-2.gif" alt="UNACCEPTABLE: student response is 'he's trying to tell you something or someone is looking at him'">
    <p>This student does not describe characteristics of the medium used to make the self-portrait, but instead offers an interpretation of what is happening in the artwork.</p>
