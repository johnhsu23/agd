<div class="question__question">
  <p>Open your packets and look at your two prints. Each print shows an image of a self-portrait created by a twentieth-century artist. Self-portrait A is by Kathe Kollwitz, and self-portrait B is by Egon Schiele. A "self-portrait" is an artwork that shows the person who created the work. The self-portraits you will be working with for this task, both of which show the faces and upper bodies of the artists, tell important things about the personalities of the people who created them. After you answer some questions about the works, you will create your own self-portrait.</p>
  <p>As you answer the questions about each self-portrait, think carefully about what the artists might have wanted to communicate about themselves in their self-portraits. Now look at each of the artworks closely and answer the questions in your test booklet.</p>
  <p>Look at self-portrait A. Compare how Kollwitz has drawn her head and hand with the way she drawn her arm. Be specific.<br/>

  <p>Explain what you think Kollwitz may have been trying to communicate about herself by drawing these different parts of her self-portrait in different ways.<br/>
