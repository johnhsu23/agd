  <p>For the question below, you are to write an ending for the rhythmic pattern you see below. You will hear it played two times. After you hear the rhythmic pattern, write an ending to the pattern in the empty measures printed in your test booklet. The music that you write should make the rhythm sound finished. You may use notes or rests in your answer, but do not copy any of the measures that are already used in the music. Make sure that the ending that you write has the correct number of beats.</p>
  <img src ="images/questions/music-sample-2.jpeg" alt="Image shows 4 measures of music in 4/4 time. The first 2 measures are filled in with notes applicable to 4/4 time, and the last 2 measure are blank for the student responses.">

  <h4>Solution:</h4>
  <p>This item measures two different skills: the ability to use the correct notation and the ability to write an appropriate ending. This scoring guide refers to the student's ability to use the correct notation.</p>

  <h4>Score and Description</h4>
  <h5 class="u-margin-none">DEVELOPED</h5>
  <p>Student writes any combination of notes or rests totaling four beats, with no technical notation errors (such as note heads not filled in properly, backward stems, or note heads on eighth notes not filled in).</p>
  <h5 class="u-margin-none">ADEQUATE</h5>
  <p>One measure of the response is completely correct with no technical errors in notation. The other measure of the notation contains the correct number of beats but contains a technical error in notation.</p>
  <h5 class="u-margin-none">PARTIAL</h5>
  <p>One measure of the response contains the correct number of beats with no technical errors in notation. The other measure is incorrect.</p>
  <p>Or:</p>
  <p>Each measure of the response has the correct number of beats but contains a technical notation error.</p>
  <p>Examples of technical notation errors include backward stems or note heads on eighth notes not filled in appropriately.</p>
  <h5 class="u-margin-none">VERY LIMITED</h5>
  <p>One measure of the response contains the correct number of beats but has a technical error in notation. The other measure contains an incorrect number of beats.</p>
  <p>Examples of technical notation errors include backward stems or note heads on eighth notes not filled in appropriately.</p>
  <h5 class="u-margin-none">INADEQUATE</h5>
  <p>Each measure of the response contains an incorrect number of beats.</p>
  <p>Examples of technical notation errors include backward stems or note heads on eighth notes not filled in appropriately.</p>

    <p>The note values provided in each measure of the response are correct; however, the note head of the final eighth note in the final measure is written on the incorrect side of the stem.</p>

    <p>The note values of each measure in this response contain the correct number of beats; however, the note heads of the second eighth note in the third measure and the second note in the fourth measure are written on the incorrect side of the stem.</p>

    <p>There are too many beats in the first measure of the response. The final measure of the response contains the correct amount of beats although the note head of the second eighth note in that measure is drawn on the incorrect side of the stem.</p>

  <h5 class="u-margin-none">INADEQUATE</h5>
  <div>
    <img src="images/questions/UECL008-inadequate.gif" alt"INADEQUATE: Student response for third measure is rest, three sixteenth notes, rest. For fourth measure, student response is dotted half note, eighth note, quarter note, and half note">
    <p>The note values provided in each of the measures of this response do not have the correct number of beats. The third measure does not have enough beats, and the final measure has too many beats.</p>
