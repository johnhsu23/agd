  <p>[MUSIC PLAYER]</p>
  <p>For question 8, you are to write an ending for the rhythmic pattern you see below. You will hear it played two times. After you hear the rhythmic pattern, write an ending to the pattern in the empty measures printed in your test booklet. The music that you write should make the rhythm sound finished. You may use notes or rests in your answer, but do not copy any of the measures that are already used in the music. Make sure that the ending that you write has the correct number of beats.</p>

  <h4>Solution:</h4>
  <p>This item measures two different skills: the ability to use the correct notation and the ability to write an appropriate ending. This scoring guide refers to the student's ability to write an appropriate ending.</p>
  <h4>Score and Description</h4>
  <h5 class="u-margin-none">DEVELOPED</h5>
  <p>Student's ending is musically and rhythmically satisfying.</p>
  <h5 class="u-margin-none">INADEQUATE</h5>
  <p>Student's ending is not musically and rhythmically satisfying, or copies measures 1 and 2.</p>
  <h4>Sample Responses</h4>
  <h5 class="u-margin-none">DEVELOPED</h5>

    <img src="img/questions/UECL008-developed.gif" alt"DEVELOPED: Student response for the third measure is two eighth notes, and three quarter notes. The response for the fourth measure is two eighth notes, two quarter notes, and rest.">
    <p>This response was judged to provide a satisfying ending to the beginning of the rhythmic pattern.</p>
  </div>
  <h5 class="u-margin-none">INADEQUATE</h5>
  <div>
    <img src="img/questions/UECL008-inadequate.gif" alt"INADEQUATE: The student response for the third measure is two quarter notes, two eighth notes, and one quarter note. For the fourth measure the response is one quarter note, two eighth notes, one quarter note, rest, one eighth note.">
    <p>This response, although it had no technical errors with respect to the use of musical notation, failed to provide a musically conclusive and satisfying ending to the rhythmic pattern.</p>
