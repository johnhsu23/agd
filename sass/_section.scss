// Definition: a "section" is what we currently call the "chart__section" class.
// A section contains these elements (at time of writing, all but "section__inner" are unimplemented):
// * section__title: The headline for this section.
// * section__controls: Any controls that modify this section (think the grade switcher)
// * section__subtitle: Currently the "chart__section__desc" class.
// * section__commentary: Commentary for this particular section.
// * section__inner: Currently used to denote the inner figure (if there is one). Could be repurposed.

// Note that figures embedded in a section are intended to control their own legend and title, so those elements
// are no longer needed at the section level.
