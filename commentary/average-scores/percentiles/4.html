  <p>NAEP reports scores at five selected percentiles to show the progress made by lower- (10th and 25th percentiles), middle- (50th percentile), and higher- (75th and 90th percentiles) performing students. In comparison to 2009, the previous assessment year, the 2015 science scores were 4 points higher for lower- and middle-performing fourth-grade students and 3 points higher for higher-performing students.</p>
