  <p>NAEP reports scores at five selected percentiles to show the progress made by lower- (10th and 25th percentiles), middle- (50th percentile), and higher- (75th and 90th percentiles) performing students. Compared to 2011, the previous assessment year, eighth-grade science scores in 2015 were 3 points higher for lower-performing students and were 2 points higher for middle- and higher-performing students. Compared to 2009, the first assessment year, scores were 5 points higher for lower-performing students and were higher by 4, 3, and 2 points at the 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles, respectively, in 2015.</p>
