<div class="section__commentary">
  <p>In 2015, the average science score for eighth-grade students was 2 points higher compared to 2011, the previous assessment year. The average science score for eighth-grade students increased by 4 points compared to the first assessment year in 2009. The NAEP science scale ranges from 0â€“300 with an overall average score set at 150.</p>
  <p>The chart below shows the trend in average scores beginning in 2009, when a new science framework was introduced. The dotted lines show cut scores indicating the lower end of the score range for each NAEP achievement level: <em>Basic</em>, <em>Proficient</em>, and <em>Advanced</em>. Read a description of each achievement level by clicking its icon.

  <p>Please note that in 2011, NAEP conducted a special administration of the science assessment at grade 8 with the purpose of comparing results with the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Therefore, 2015 results at grade 8 are compared to results from the 2011 and 2009 assessments. <a href="#about#framework4">See more information about the special science assessment.</a> </p>
