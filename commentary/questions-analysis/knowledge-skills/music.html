  <p>A more in-depth understanding of what students know and can do in relation to the content and processes in responding to music may be gained by viewing the knowledge and skills demonstrated by student performance at different score points on the music responding scale.  Scores for the 25th and 75th percentiles are also shown.</p>
  <p>The descriptions listed below indicate some of the music knowledge and skills demonstrated by eighth-grade students in answering responding questions administered as part of the 2016 arts assessment. For example, eighth-grade students who achieved a score of 231 on the music portion of the 2016 arts assessment were likely to correctly answer a question that required them to “describe an emotion or mood created by a composition and two ways in which they were created.” These students would also be likely to correctly answer questions associated with a score lower than 231.</p>
  <p>Questions from the 2016 arts assessment are available in the <a target="_blank" href="http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/nqt/Home/LegacyGen0Bookmark?subject=arts">NAEP Questions Tool</a>. See an <a target="_blank" href="http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/itemmaps?subj=Music&grade=8">item map</a> with more descriptions of students’ music skills.
