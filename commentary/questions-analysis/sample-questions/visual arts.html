<div class="section__commentary">
  <p>The visual arts portion of the 2016 arts assessment measured students’ ability to respond to and create works of art.</p>
  <ul>
     <li>Responding questions measured students’ knowledge of media, techniques, context, form, and function as well as their ability to articulate and apply judgments about works of art. Students were asked to analyze, interpret, and describe works of art and design.</li>
     <li>Creating questions measured students’ skills and knowledge in planning and generating works of art and design that reflect their understanding of values, aesthetics, and context as well as their ability to effectively use media and techniques to communicate meaning in their art work. Students were asked to create original artwork including a self-portrait.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Examples of the different types of visual arts responding and creating questions including how student performed on them are presented below. <a href="#/about">Learn more about the discipline of visual arts in the NAEP arts assessment</a>.</p>  
<p>There were a total of four visual arts sections in the arts assessment. Each student who was assessed in visual arts was presented with two of the four sections. In total, students were asked to answer between 15 and 21 multiple-choice and constructed-response (or open-ended) questions. Many of the visual arts questions in the assessment included multiple parts. The amount of time provided for students to complete two visual arts sections ranged from 75 minutes to 104 minutes.</p>
