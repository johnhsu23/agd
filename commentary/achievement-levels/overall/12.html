  <p>Achievement levels are performance standards showing what students should know and be able to do. Results are reported as percentages of students performing at or above three achievement levels (<em>Basic</em>, <em>Proficient</em>, and <em>Advanced</em>). Students performing at or above <em>Proficient</em> on NAEP assessments demonstrate solid academic performance and competency over challenging subject matter.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In 2015, twenty-two percent of twelfth-grade students performed at or above the <em>Proficient</em> level on the science assessment compared to 21 percent of students in 2009, the previous assessment year. This apparent one-percentage point difference was not statistically significant. </li>
    <li>In comparison to 2009, there were no significant differences in the percentage of twelfth-graders who performed at or above the <em>Basic</em> level or below the <em>Basic</em> level in 2015.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Interpreting the results</strong></p>
  <p>NAEP achievement level setting is based on the collective judgments of a broadly representative panel of teachers, education specialists, and members of the general public.  As provided by law, NAEP achievement levels are to be used on a trial basis and should be interpreted and used with caution.  <a target="_blank" href="http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/achievement.aspx">Read more about how NAEP achievement levels are set</a>. </p>
