  <p>Achievement levels are performance standards showing what students should know and be able to do. Results are reported as percentages of students performing at or above three achievement levels (<em>Basic</em>, <em>Proficient</em>, and <em>Advanced</em>). Students performing at or above the <em>Proficient</em> level on NAEP assessments demonstrate solid academic performance and competency over challenging subject matter.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In 2015, thirty-four percent of eighth-grade students performed at or above the <em>Proficient</em> level on the science assessment, which was 2 percentage points higher compared to 2011, the previous assessment year. The percentage of eighth-grade students performing at or above the <em>Proficient</em> level in 2015 was 4 percentage points higher compared to 2009, the first assessment year.</li>
    <li>In comparison to both 2009 and 2011, the percentage of eighth-graders who performed at or above the <em>Basic</em> level was also higher in 2015, while the percentage of students who performed below <em>Basic</em> was lower. </li>

  <p><strong>Interpreting the results</strong></p>
  <p>NAEP achievement level setting is based on the collective judgments of a broadly representative panel of teachers, education specialists, and members of the general public.  As provided by law, NAEP achievement levels are to be used on a trial basis and should be interpreted and used with caution.<a target="_blank" href="http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/achievement.aspx">Read more about how NAEP achievement levels are set</a>[</p>
