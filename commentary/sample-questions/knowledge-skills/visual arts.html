  <p>A more in-depth understanding of what students know and can do in relation to the content and processes in responding to visual arts may be gained by viewing the knowledge and skills demonstrated by student performance at different score points on the visual arts responding scale, as shown below.  For example, eighth-grade students who achieved a score of 297 on the visual arts portion of the 2016 arts assessment would be likely to correctly answer a question that required them to “provide a perceptive, specific commentary on at least three chosen features.” These students would also be likely to correctly answer questions associated with a score lower than 297.</p>
  <p>Questions from the 2016 arts assessment are available in the <a target="_blank" href="http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/nqt/Home/LegacyGen0Bookmark?subject=arts">NAEP Questions Tool</a>. See an <a target="_blank" href="http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/itemmaps/?subj=visualarts&grade=8">item map</a> with more descriptions of students' visual arts skills.
