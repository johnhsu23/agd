  <p>The music portion of the 2016 arts assessment measured studentsâ€™ ability to respond to music, which included analyzing and critiquing musical performances, identifying and explaining musical notation, describing the emotion or mood of a composition, and identifying the region of origin or social context of a musical excerpt. The music portion also included one creating question that asked students to use music notation to write an ending to a rhythmic pattern. </p>
  <p>There were a total of four music sections in the arts assessment. Each student who was assessed in music was presented with two of the four sections. In total, students were asked to answer between 19 and 31 multiple-choice and constructed-response (or open-ended) questions. Many of the music questions in the assessment included multiple parts. Because the length of the recorded music that was played for students varied in each section, the amount of time provided for students to complete two music sections ranged from 58 minutes to 63 minutes. </p>
  <p>The list below shows the percentage of students who answered a multiple-choice question correctly or who received full credit for their answer to a constructed-response question. <a href="#/visual-arts/sample-questions?anchor=footer" class="js-footer">Trend results for multiple-choice questions</a> from the 1997, 2008, and 2016 arts assessments are available in the data tables at the bottom of this report.</p>
