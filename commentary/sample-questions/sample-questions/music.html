<div class="section__commentary">
  <p>The music portion of the 2016 arts assessment measured studentsâ€™ ability to respond to music, which included analyzing and critiquing musical performances, identifying and explaining musical notation, describing the emotion or mood of a composition, and identifying the region of origin or social context of a musical excerpt. The music portion also included one constructed-response question that asked students to use music notation to write an ending to a rhythmic pattern. Due to budget constraints, this was the only question in the assessment that asked students to create music.</p>
  <p>Examples of music responding and creating questions including how students performed on them are presented below. <a href="#/about">Learn more about the discipline of music in the NAEP arts assessment</a>.</p>
  <p>There were a total of four music sections in the arts assessment. Each student who was assessed in music was presented with two of the four sections. In total, students were asked to answer between 19 and 31 multiple-choice and constructed-response (or open-ended) questions. Many of the music questions in the assessment included multiple parts. Because the length of the recorded music that was played for students varied in each section, the amount of time provided for students to complete two music sections ranged from 58 minutes to 63 minutes.
