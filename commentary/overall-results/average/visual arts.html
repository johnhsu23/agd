  <p>Visual arts knowledge and skills include understanding the meaning of visual form and how it is conveyed, as well as understanding how to construct or interpret meaning in visual form. The visual arts portion of the 2016 arts assessment measured students’ ability to respond to art as well as their ability to create original artwork. For example, a responding question asked students to analyze the aesthetic properties of two self-portraits created by twentieth-century artists and to identify technical similarities between the two artworks.

<p>The average visual arts responding score for eighth-grade students in 2016 was 149, which was not significantly different from 2008, the previous assessment year. The NAEP visual arts scale ranges from 0–300. The NAEP visual arts scale is based on responding questions only.</p>
