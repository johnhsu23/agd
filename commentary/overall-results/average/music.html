<div class="section__commentary">
  <p>The average music responding score for eighth-grade students in 2016 was 147, which was not significantly different from 2008, the previous assessment year.</p>
  <p>The music portion of the 2016 arts assessment asked students to respond to music, which included evaluating musical performances, identifying and explaining musical notation, describing the emotion or mood of a composition, and identifying the region of origin or social context of a musical excerpt. For example, after listening to a piece of music, students were asked to identify the musicâ€™s region of origin and to describe a feature of the music that helped them to identify the part of the world that they selected.</p>

		<h4>NOTE:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The arts assessment included one music creating question. Therefore, only the responding process in music is reported for the 2016 arts assessment. Results for the creating music questions as well as other questions from the 2016 arts assessment are available in the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/nqt/" target="_blank">NAEP Questions Tool</a>. Read more about the <a target="_blank" <a href="#about">responding and creating processes</a> in the 2016 arts assessment.</li>
			<li>The responding scales for music and visual arts were developed independently because music and visual arts are distinct disciplines. Therefore, their results are not combined into a single score and cannot be compared to each other.
