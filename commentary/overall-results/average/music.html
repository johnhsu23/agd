  <p>Music responding questions in the 2016 arts assessment asked students to evaluate musical performances, identify and explain musical notation, describe the emotion or mood of a composition, and identify the region of origin or social context of a musical excerpt. For example, after listening to a piece of music, students were asked to identify the music's region of origin and to describe a feature of the music that helped them to identify the part of the world that they selected.</p>

		<h4>NOTE:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The arts assessment included one music creating question; therefore, only average scale scores for the responding process were reported for the 2016 arts assessment. Results for the creating music questions as well as other questions from the 2016 arts assessment are available in the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/nqt/" target="_blank">NAEP Questions Tool</a>. Read more about the <a href="#/about?anchor=design">responding and creating processes</a> in the 2016 arts assessment.</li>
			<li>The responding scales for music and visual arts were developed independently because music and visual arts are distinct disciplines. Therefore, their results are not combined into a single score and cannot be compared to each other.
