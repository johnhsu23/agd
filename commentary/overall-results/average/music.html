<div class="section__commentary">
  <p>The music portion of the 2016 arts assessment measured students’ ability to respond to music, which included analyzing and critiquing musical performances, identifying and explaining musical notation, describing the emotion or mood of a composition, and identifying the region of origin or social context of a musical excerpt. For example, after listening to a piece of music, students were asked to identify the music’s region of origin and to describe a feature of the music that helped them to identify the part of the world that they selected.
	</p>
	<p>The average music responding score for eighth-grade students in 2016 was 147, which was not significantly different from 2008, the previous assessment year. The NAEP music scale ranges from 0–300. The NAEP music scale is based on responding questions only.</p>

		<h4>NOTE:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Due to budget…the arts assessment included only one music creating question. Therefore, an average creating task score is not reported for the music portion of the 2016 arts assessment. Results for the creating music question as well as other questions from the 2016 arts assessment are available in the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/nqt/" target="_blank">NAEP Questions Tool</a>. Read more about the <a target="_blank" <a href="#about">responding and creating processes</a> in the 2016 arts assessment.</li>
			<li>Because the music and visual arts are distinct disciplines, the responding scales for each were developed independently and the results therefore cannot be compared.
