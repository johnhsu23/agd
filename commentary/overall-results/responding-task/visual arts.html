<div class="section__commentary">
  <p>Because the NAEP arts framework describes the integration of the artistic processes of responding and creating, exploring the relationship between students’ results on the responding and creating questions in visual arts can provide insight into the students’ visual arts skills as well as their understanding of the social contexts in which visual arts exist. In general, students who performed well on the responding questions also performed well on the creating questions. For example, students performing above the 75th percentile on the responding scale also had the highest average creating task score (62). Lower-performing students at or below the 25th percentile on the responding scale had the lowest average creating task score (38).</p>
