  <p>Creating questions in visual arts required students to generate their own original works of art and design, which included expressing their unique and personal ideas, feelings, and responses in the form of a visual image or creative design. For example, students were asked to create a self&ndash;portrait that was scored for identifying detail, compositional elements, and use of materials. The average creating task score for visual arts is reported separately as the average percentage of the maximum possible score from 0 to 100.

In 2016, the average creating task score in visual arts was 51.</p>
  <p>Although the creating questions in the 2016 visual arts portion of the assessment were the same as those administered in the previous assessment in 2008, the creating task score results cannot be compared between the 2 years because of the small number of these questions in the arts assessment.

  <p>Because the NAEP arts framework describes the integration of the artistic processes of responding and creating, exploring the relationship between students' results on the responding and creating questions in visual arts can provide insight into the students' visual arts skills as well as their understanding of the social contexts in which visual arts exist. In general, students who performed well on the responding questions also performed well on the creating questions. For example, students performing above the 75th percentile on the responding scale also had the highest average creating task score (62). Lower&ndash;performing students at or below the 25th percentile on the responding scale had the lowest average creating task score (38).</p>
