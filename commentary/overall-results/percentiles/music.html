<div class="section__commentary">
  <p>NAEP reports scores at five selected percentiles to show the progress made by lower- (10th and 25th percentiles), middle- (50th percentile), and higher- (75th and 90th percentiles) performing students. In 2016, eighth-grade students exhibited a wide range of music responding scores, from 103 for lower-performing students at the 10th percentile to 192 for higher-performing students at the 90th percentile. Students at the 50th percentile had a music responding score of 148. Scores for eighth-grade students at each of the five selected percentiles were not significantly different compared to 2008, the previous assessment year.
