  <p>Results by demographic groups are important to examine because they help to show whether systemic score differences exist across the population of students.</p>
  <p>In 2016, the average responding score in visual arts for White eighth-grade students was 19 points higher than the average score for their Hispanic peers. This score difference was smaller than the 26-point difference in 2008, the previous assessment year.</p>
  <p>In addition, in 2016 score disparities for selected student groups showed the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Asian/Pacific Islander students scored 8 points higher on average than White students in 2016 while there was no significant difference between these two student groups in 2008.</li>
    <li>Although students not eligible for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) scored 22 points higher on average than students eligible for the NSLP, this score difference was smaller than the 29-point score difference in 2008.</li>
