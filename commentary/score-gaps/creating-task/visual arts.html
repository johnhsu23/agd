<div class="section__subtitle">Score gaps in creating visual arts show similar patterns to score gaps in responding to visual arts for selected student groups</div>
<div class="section__commentary">
  <p>Creating questions in visual arts required students to generate their own original works of art and design, which included expressing their unique and personal ideas, feelings, and responses in the form of a visual image or creative design. For example, students were asked to create a self-portrait that was scored for identifying detail, compositional elements, and use of materials. The average creating task score for visual arts is reported separately as the average percentage of the maximum possible score from 0 to 100.

	<p>Results by demographic groups are important to examine because they help to show whether systemic score differences exist across the population of students.</p>
	<p>Overall, patterns in creating score differences in visual arts by selected student groups show the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>White students scored 13 points higher than their Black peers and 8 points higher than their Hispanic peers.</li>
		<li>Female students scored 7 points higher than their male peers.</li>
		<li>Students who reported that at least one parent graduated from college or had some education after high school scored higher than students who reported lower levels of parental education.</li>
	</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>Because responding results are presented as scale scores and creating results are presented as average percentages, it is not possible to compare the magnitude of differences between these scores. For example, the 30-point difference on the 0–300 responding scale between White and Black students is not necessarily greater than the 13-point difference between the same two groups on the 0–100 creating task scale.</li>
			<li>Although the creating questions in the 2016 visual arts portion of the assessment were the same as those administered in the previous assessment in 2008, the creating task score results cannot be compared between the 2 years because the creating task score calculation was based on a small number of questions. <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/arts/interpret_results.aspx" target="_blank">Read more about how to interpret NAEP arts results.</a></li>
